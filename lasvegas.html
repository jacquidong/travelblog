                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Las Vegas, also known as the “Gambling capital of the world” is home to the mega-casino hotels, shopping, and fine dining. The heart of Vegas is known as “The Strip” which is just over 6.4 kilometers. Themed hotels such as the Paris Hotel, the Venetian, the Bellagio (with the fountain water show) and also the New York Hotel are situated right on the footpaths of the boulevard. Each of these hotels is themed, suited to the name, e.g the Venetian has a canal running through the middle and the Paris Hotel has an Eiffel Tower outside and inside the complex. </p>

                <h2>BEST BUFFETS TO VISIT</h2>

                <h3>THE BUFFET (WYNN HOTEL)</h3>
                <p>One of the best buffets I’ve ever been to was “The Buffet” at the Wynn Hotel. This buffet is newly refurbished and was voted the best buffet in Las Vegas this year. With 15 live cooking stations creating over 120 different dishes, there is a cuisine to suit everyone! The environment is bright and airy with spring colours, marble floor accents and amazing topiaries. The buffet offers breakfast, lunch and dinner to the public. The buffet has a range of Italian, French, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, American, Mediterranean, Sushi, European, Asian cuisines! They are also very considerate about dietary requirements with Vegetarian Friendly, Vegan Options and Gluten Free plates. All round, this is definitely a buffet to visit when you next go to Vegas!
                </p>

                <h3>BACCHANAL BUFFET (CAESARS PALACE)</h3>
                <p>Not only is Caesars Palace famous for their gambling and shopping centre, the 600 seat Bacchanal-buffet is one one of the most impressive buffets in Vegas. With over 500 different dishes prepared daily from more than 800 recipes, the Bacchanal-buffet is fitted to please everyone. Similar to “The Buffet” at the Wynn, the Bacchanal-buffet has American, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine as well as Seafood, Pizza, Deli, and an impressive Dessert Station. The wait in the lines to get into the buffet is quite long but it is definitely worth it, you can also pay extra to skip the line and get in faster. The surrounding within the buffet was quite dark so it was hard to see what you were eating and the service wasn’t as good as the service at the the Wynn buffet. Overall this buffet was worth the wait in the queue and lived up to the hype but if i’d have to choose one buffet out of the two I would highly recommend “The Buffet” at the Wynn hotel!</p>
