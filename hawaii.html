            <h2>PLACES TO VISIT</h2>

            <h3>LANIKAI PILLBOX HIKE</h3>

            <p>The Lanikai Pillbox hike, also known as the Kaiwa Ridge Trail is one of the most picturesque hikes in Oahu. This hike takes around 1 hour tops (roundtrip) and is often flooded with tourists throughout the whole day. This hike isn't for beginners and is ranked immediate as there trail isn’t patched, although it is a reasonably easy trail. The view from the pillboxes is well worth the hike in the blistering heat and you get a 360 degrees view of the Lanikai Beach as well as Kailua. </p>

            <h3>DIAMOND HEAD HIKE</h3>
            <p>The Diamond Head (Le’ahi) hike is one of the most hikes in Oahu. When you reach the top of the crater, there are magnificent views of the Waikiki shore line. This trail is definitely easier than the Lanikai Pillbox hike as the trail is fully paved. There is a charge on entry of $1 per pedestrian entry of $5 per car but it's worth it. At the top of the crater, there will be a bunker you can stand on top on and there are also other bunkers if you continue walking down the trail. This hike takes around an hour to reach the top of the summit and there are multiple scenic pit stops throughout the trail. </p>

            <h3>ALAMOANA SHOPPING CENTRE</h3>
            <p>Ala Moana is the largest shopping centre within Hawaii and is the largest open-air shopping center in the world. There are 4 full department stores at different ends in ala moana - Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus, Macy’s and Nordstrom. You can spend endless hours shopping at the mall as there are over 290 stores and around 80 dine in locations. The stores range from luxury brands such as Tiffany & Co and Louis Vuitton to more casual brands like Forever21 and American Apparel! The stores are endless and there are many stores to suit everyone!
